    <p>In an impressive rise, Mohamed Bamba transitioned from playing for Hapoel Rishon LeZion in Israel's second division to joining French side FC Lorient in just one season. During the 2022-23 season at Rishon LeZion, Bamba distinguished himself as the top scorer in Liga Leumit, netting 20 goals and leading his team to victory in the Toto Cup Leumit. His combination of athleticism, scoring ability, and off-the-ball movement caught the attention of international scouts.

        In July 2023, Bamba moved to Austria's Bundesliga, joining Wolfsberger AC on a three-year contract. He quickly made an impact, scoring five goals in his first seven appearances. Despite this short stint, his impressive performances attracted interest from higher-level clubs.
        
        Just six months later, in January 2024, FC Lorient, then competing in Ligue 1, signed Bamba for a reported €3.5 million. His debut for Lorient was remarkable—he scored a goal within minutes of stepping onto the field, and soon matched a long-standing club record with five goals in his first four matches
        
        
        Bamba's rapid ascent highlights his adaptability and growth, moving from relative obscurity in Israel to becoming a key player in one of Europe’s top leagues within a year.

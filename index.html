<p class="try">Mohamed Bamba is a 22-year-old Ivorian footballer who currently plays as a center-forward for FC Lorient in France. He began his career in the Ivory Coast with Bouaké FC and later moved to Israel, playing for Hapoel Rishon LeZion, where he made a significant impact by becoming the top scorer in the 2022–23 Liga Leumit season with 20 goals. After a short stint in Austria with Wolfsberger AC, where he continued to shine, Bamba transferred to Lorient in January 2024.

    Bamba quickly made his mark at Lorient, scoring a goal in his debut match just two days after signing with the club. In his first few games, he managed to score five goals in four appearances, equaling a club record set in 1973. Known for his athleticism and off-the-ball movement, Bamba has proven to be a valuable asset to Lorient</p>
